# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Threat Hunt Report: **Hide Your RDP ‚Äì Password Spray Leads to Full Compromise**

**Analyst:** Peter Van Rossum  
**Date Completed:** 21-September-2025  
**Environment Investigated:** slflarewinsysmo (Windows host, internal user segment)  
**Timeframe:** September 16, 2025 ‚Äì 11:43:46 to 12:43:42 (UTC)  
**Duration:** 59 minutes, 56 seconds  

---

## üß† Scenario Overview
Suspicious RDP activity against a cloud-hosted Windows system (`slflarewinsysmo`) escalated into full compromise. The attacker brute-forced valid credentials, executed a malicious binary, established persistence, impaired defenses, ran discovery commands, archived sensitive data, and attempted exfiltration to an external server. This hunt reconstructs the timeline, identifies the attacker‚Äôs techniques, and correlates Sysmon, Defender, and Sentinel telemetry to flag key adversary actions.

---

## üéØ Executive Summary
The adversary gained access via brute-forced RDP credentials (`slflare`), executed `msupdate.exe`, and persisted with a scheduled task (`MicrosoftUpdateSync`). They disabled Windows Defender scanning, ran reconnaissance (`systeminfo`), staged sensitive data into `backup_sync.zip`, and attempted to exfiltrate it via `curl` to `185.92.220.87:8081`. Multiple outbound connections (PowerShell, msupdate.exe, curl) to `185.92.220.87` indicate C2 activity. The attacker‚Äôs intent was **data theft**, with exfiltration staged from the SLFlare user profile.

## üî∑ Diamond Model Summary

- **Adversary:** External attacker using brute-force RDP from `159.26.106.84`  
- **Infrastructure:** Remote IP `185.92.220.87`, port `8081` for exfiltration  
- **Capabilities:** Credential access, persistence via scheduled tasks, defense evasion, discovery, exfiltration  
- **Victim:** Windows host `slflarewinsysmo`, user account `slflare`  

---

## üìå Lessons Learned
- External RDP access remains a high-risk entry vector.  
- Lack of MFA allowed brute-force compromise.  
- Data staging in `AppData\Local\Temp` indicates poor endpoint monitoring coverage.  
- Outbound traffic controls insufficient to block malicious curl exfiltration.  

---

## üõ† Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. Disable RDP exposure to the internet or enforce VPN-only access.  
2. Force password reset for `slflare` and all privileged accounts.  
3. Block outbound connections to `185.92.220.87` and monitor for related IOCs.  

### Short-term Improvements (1‚Äì30 days)
1. Enforce MFA for all remote access accounts.  
2. Harden scheduled task creation monitoring with alerting.  
3. Audit and reset Windows Defender exclusions across endpoints.  

### Long-term Security Enhancements
1. Implement network segmentation to isolate user workstations from sensitive resources.  
2. Deploy DLP (Data Loss Prevention) and outbound proxy controls.  
3. Regularly conduct red team simulations of RDP brute force and exfiltration.  

### Detection Improvements (Optional)
- **Monitoring Gaps Identified:** Lack of visibility on archive creation and Defender exclusion.  
- **Recommended Alerts:** New scheduled tasks, Defender exclusions, abnormal curl usage.  
- **Query Improvements:** Expand hunting queries to baseline and flag abnormal `cmd.exe` + `systeminfo` usage.
